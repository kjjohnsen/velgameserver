This page contains a list of callbacks that respond to events in VelNet. Callbacks are essential in networked applications due to the nature of asynchronous code.

- OnJoinedRoom
- OnLeftRoom
- OnPlayerJoined
- OnPlayerLeft
- OnConnectedToServer
- OnLoggedIn
- RoomsReceived
- RoomDataReceived
- MessageReceived
- CustomMessageReceived
- OnLocalNetworkObjectSpawned
- OnNetworkObjectSpawned
- OnNetworkObjectDestroyed

The `TestCallbacks.cs` file in the FullExample implements these callbacks and logs the events to the console.
